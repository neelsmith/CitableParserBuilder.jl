## Outline

### Parsing to identifiers

- `CitableParserBuilder.jl` was motivated by study of historical languages
- these are closed productions requiring a corpus-linguistic approach
- in 2024, personal computers are adequate to handle complete pre-computed parsing output of all possible forms (stem * rule products)
- therefore `CitableParserBuilder.jl` implements an in-memory parsing system


### Resolving identifiers

- the `Analysis` type is concrete
- its four identifiers can be used in relation to any model of lexeme, form, stem or rule.
