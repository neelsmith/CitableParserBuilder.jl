Natural languages have very different morphological structures. Nevertheless, we can define general patterns for the process of analyzing the morphology of a digital text, and expressing the results in terms of citable scholarly resources.[^mid]




[^mid]: The model of citable morphological parsing presented here was developed over many years in the work of the Holy Cross Manuscripts, Inscriptions and Documents Club (MID). 



## Parsing and analyses

*Parsing* operates on individual tokens. It therefore presupposes and requires an [explicit orthographic system defining tokenization](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/orthography/concepts/), and classifying the resulting tokens.  *Morphological parsing* operates on *lexical tokens* (and not on puncutation, numbers, or other types of non-lexical tokens). 

Morphologically parsing a token produces zero or more *morphological analyses*. 

A morphological analysis identifies a *morphological form*  and a *lexeme* for the token. An analysis of the English word "books", for example, might indicate that this form is a plural noun of a lexeme with the dictionary form "book."

Lexical tokens are often treated as the result of applying a rule to a stem. An English parser, for example, might interpret the token "books" as the result of applying to a stem "book" a rule to add an ending "s" to create a plural form. 

We can therefore model a morphological analysis as associating four pieces of information with a token: a lexeme and a form that together identify the morphology of the token; and a stem and inflectional rule that together explain *how* the analysis arrived at the resulting lexeme and form.

Each of these four pieces of information can be represented by a unique identifier encoded as a URN.

1. the *lexeme*
2. the *morphological form*
3. the *stem* used to arrive at the analysis
4. the *inflectional rule* used to arrive at the analysis


 The structure of the form identified will vary from one language to another.
