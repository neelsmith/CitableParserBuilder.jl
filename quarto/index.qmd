title: "Citable parsers"

This site introduces the conceptual model of a citable morphological parser developed over many years in the work of the Holy Cross Manuscripts, Inscriptions and Documents Club (MID). 

It also includes documentation of `CitableParserBuilder.jl`, a Julia package that implements the MID model of citable morphological analysis. `CitableParserBuilder.jl` defines common functions and data structures for working with citable morphological analyses of citable texts.
